<h3>P.S.</h3>
<p>Channels (chats) do not have to be on the same server. <strong>It is important that the bot is a member of both servers and has access to reading messages (in the channel from where messages should be taken) and sending messages (in the channel where messages should be forwarded)</strong></p>

<i>The bot was created in November 2023 as part of an order, the customer of which stopped contacting. I don't plan to update this bot in the near future.</i>
